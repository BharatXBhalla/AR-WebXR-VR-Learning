three.js compactibility issue uses WEBGL

Best experience in chrome 

set canvas size in css

scene us what user interact with 

perspectiveCamera -- more deep smaller things and vica versa
75 degress ratio of width and height  0.1 - near cliiping 100 far clipping plan 

orthographicamera -- projecting on a paper as parallel

renderer WE BGLRender add to dom 

there is a up update function  

for a shape we need a mesh and a material 

controls let us nagivate a scene

ligths :
basic materials aren't affected by lights used

lights require color and intensity 

materials types: 

1) Phong -- Shiny
2) Blinn
3) Lambert -- Matte Finish
4) Constant -- like basic materials

if lights are not added to scene then all materials which are 1)-3) do not show up
